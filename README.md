## Description
This repo is the result of a couple hours exploring solid.js and svg rendering. It renders buyer journeys as paths through time towards a sale (or a failed sale). Each touchpoint with the buyer (web, social, etc) creates a kink in their journey line.

### Getting started
- clone this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:jakemoves/watersheds.git
